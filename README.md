The purpose of this project is to demonstrate competence in fetching and handling data via an API - in this case, the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

Retrieving the weather data also involves the use of Asynchronous JavaScript, to ensure the proper ordering and execution of tasks.
